Project Description: Supermarket Sales Data Analysis
We will perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a supermarket sales dataset to uncover insights and patterns. Our tasks include:

Task 1: Initial Data Exploration
Load and inspect the dataset.
View sample rows.

Task 2: Univariate Analysis
Summarize data with statistics.
Visualize data distribution.
Identify outliers.

Task 3: Bivariate Analysis
Create visualizations to explore relationships between variables.
Analyze interactions between categorical and numerical data.
Identify patterns and trends.

Task 4: Handle Duplicates and Missing Values
Remove duplicate rows.
Identify and handle missing values.

Task 5: Correlation Analysis
Calculate and visualize correlations between variables.
Identify strong correlations for insights.

This project will provide a thorough understanding of the supermarket sales data to make informed decisions.
