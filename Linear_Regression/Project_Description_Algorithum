Goal:
The goal of this project is to build a linear regression model to predict the number of bikes sold monthly by a retail company. 
The model will use historical data on monthly bike sales to make predictions based on factors such as time.

Dataset: The dataset includes historical data on monthly bike sales by the retail company. Each data point consists of the month and 
the corresponding number of bikes sold.

Tools and Libraries: Python programming language, Jupyter Notebook for interactive development and documentation, Pandas for data 
manipulation, NumPy for numerical computations, Matplotlib for data visualization, Scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms and 
evaluation metrics

Algorithm Overview:

1) Load and Explore Data: Load the historical data on monthly bike sales from a CSV file. Explore the data to understand its structure 
and basic statistics.

2) Prepare Data: Preprocess the data if necessary, handling missing values and converting categorical variables. Split the data into
input features (months) and target variable (number of bikes sold).

3) Visualize Data: Generate visualizations to understand the relationship between time (months) and the number of bikes sold.

4) Train-Test Split: Split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

5) Initialize Parameters: Initialize the parameters (weights and bias) for the linear regression model.

6) Hypothesis Function: Define the hypothesis function to predict the number of bikes sold based on the month (input feature) and 
model parameters.

7) Cost Function: Define the cost function to measure the model's performance by calculating the mean squared error.

8) Gradient Descent: Implement gradient descent to optimize the model parameters (weights and bias) based on the training data.

9) Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate evaluation metrics such as mean squared error.

10) Make Predictions: Use the trained model to make predictions for the next month's bike sales.

11) Project Deployment: Deploy the trained model in an environment if applicable.
