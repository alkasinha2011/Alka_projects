Project Description: Predicting the Number of Bikes Sold in a Month

Objective: Develop a machine learning model to predict the number of bikes sold in a month based on various features such as advertising budget, price of bikes, seasonal factors, 
and other relevant variables.

Steps:
1. Data Collection: Gather historical sales data, advertising expenditure, bike prices, and other relevant features over several months.  First, we import the necessary libraries and load
our dataset. Libraries: numpy: For numerical operations, pandas: For data manipulation and analysis, sklearn: For machine learning tools.

2. Data Preprocessing: Clean the data, remove duplicates, ensure consistancy in data format, handle missing values, and perform feature engineering. We select the relevant columns
(features) from our dataset that will help us predict bike sales. In this case, we choose 'Advertising', 'Price', and 'Season'.

3. Feature Scaling: Normalize the features to ensure they are on a comparable scale. We scale the features so they are on a similar scale. This helps the model learn better.
   We use StandardScaler to transform the features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

4. Generate Polynomial Features: We create new features that are combinations of the original features up to a specified degree (in this case, degree 2). This helps the model capture 
non-linear relationships in the data.

5. Modeling: Implement multiple linear regression.

6. Extend to polynomial regression to capture non-linear relationships.

7. Optimization: Use gradient descent with vectorization to optimize the model parameters.

8. Evaluation: Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance using appropriate metrics and validate its predictive power.

9. Deployment: Deploy the model for predicting future bike sales
