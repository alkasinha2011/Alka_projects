AI-Driven Predictive Maintenance and Anomaly Detection for Autonomous Vehicles

Overview:
This project tackles important problems related to maintaining and ensuring the safety of autonomous vehicles. It combines different AI
technologies like Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision (CV), Generative AI, and Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) 
to improve how we detect issues, predict when maintenance is needed, and make decisions in real-time. Using Google Cloud Platform (GCP),
these models are deployed in a way that handles different types of data to keep vehicles running smoothly and safely.

Key Components:
1. NLP for Vehicle Diagnostics and User Interface
Real-World Problem: Vehicle diagnostic data can be hard to understand for regular users like drivers or fleet managers. The technical
 language used can make it difficult to act on the information.
Solution: Fine-tune a large language model (LLM) that breaks down complicated vehicle data into simple, easy-to-understand insights,
 giving clear recommendations on what needs to be fixed.
Technology: An LLM like GPT-3 or PaLM is fine-tuned to summarize diagnostic logs and suggest maintenance actions. This model is deployed
on GCP’s Vertex AI, allowing it to handle real-time interactions with users and give simplified reports.

2. Computer Vision for Anomaly Detection and Object Tracking
Real-World Problem: Autonomous vehicles need to detect defects and navigate safely. Analyzing visual and sensor data in real-time is
essential to prevent breakdowns and ensure safety on the road.
Solution: Use computer vision models to spot any issues in vehicle parts and track objects around the vehicle to ensure it navigates
safely.
Technology: Pre-trained CV models like YOLOv5 are used for object detection, and few-shot learning techniques are applied for anomaly
detection. These models are deployed using GCP’s AI tools to process data in real-time and on a large scale.

3. Generative AI for 3D Scene Generation and Simulations
Real-World Problem: Autonomous vehicles need to understand their environment accurately for safe driving. Simulating real-world driving
 conditions helps improve their ability to make decisions and navigate tricky situations.
Solution: Use generative AI to create 3D scenes from vehicle sensor data. These scenes simulate real-world conditions, helping vehicles
 plan their movements and improve safety.
Technology: A fine-tuned stable diffusion model generates realistic 3D environments based on the data from sensors. These scenes are used
 to simulate different driving conditions. GCP’s machine learning pipelines are used to fine-tune and deploy these models, making sure
they scale easily.

4. PINNs for Vehicle Dynamics Simulation
Real-World Problem: Mechanical failures in vehicle parts like engines or cooling systems can lead to expensive repairs or even dangerous
situations. Simulating these failures can help predict and prevent them.
Solution: Use Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to simulate how vehicles behave under different conditions, like airflow around the
 car or how parts heat up, so potential problems can be detected early.
Technology: PINNs are developed to model how the vehicle’s parts behave, predicting issues before they happen. These simulations are
deployed on GCP Vertex AI Workbench and use real-time sensor data to predict when maintenance is needed.
